This repo contains Super useful handy commands to perform simple and
complex task on the command line. Powershell has powerful command line
functionality due to it interopability with visual basic script, the
.NET sdk and installed apps. This project also exports over 100 built in
commands in powershell to be used from the Windows Command prompt.

Most powershell only commands are wrapped into batch and bash to make
them available on windows command prompt and linux shell. This script is
most useful if you enjoy the power of linux and unix terminal or you
switch between other OSes and Windows often.

Do not heisitate to send in a PR with your awesome powershell script.

Requirements
------------

-  Powershell 2+
-  Windows Command Prompt on Microsoft Windows
-  Any shell on Linux and unix

Installation
------------

The script provides wrapper commands for various application e.g git,
kubectl. The main requirement for Cronux is powershell 3 and above.

Install
~~~~~~~

Powershell
^^^^^^^^^^

Run your powershell as admin and execute:

.. code:: powershell

   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://thecarisma.github.io/installx.ps1'))

Git Bash
^^^^^^^^

If you have git bash installed use the one line command below to install
cronux

.. code:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Thecarisma/Cronux.git && cd ./Cronux && ./Cronux.sh installx

Download Zip and Extract
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the zip archive from the repo or release page, extract it to
any folder on your disk and execute Cronux from within the folder.

To use all the commands you will need to prefix the word **Cronux**
before the command e.g ``Cronux clear``, ``Cronux sudo`` e.t.c to make
the command available independent of Cronux itself install Cronux with:

::

   Cronux.bat installx

Uninstall
~~~~~~~~~

To uninstall the Entrie Cronux and it sub commands Scripts use the
command below

::

   Cronux uninstallx

To remove a single command for example when an actual program with the
same full functionality has been installed e.g the **ls** command which
mimics the windows **dir.exe** program should be removed when the real
program **ls.exe** is installed (e.g from the mingwn compiler
toolchain).

::

   Cronux removecommand ls

Update
~~~~~~

If you already have Cronux installed you can execute the ``updatex``
command to update to the latest version.

.. code:: powershell

   updatex

or

.. code:: powershell

   Cronux updatex

Creating alias
--------------

The ``shorty`` command can be used to create a short alias for a long
command. So instead of executing a long command from the CLI the alias
script can be called to execute the commands e.g. the following command
add edited stage files then commit it with the message ‘new feature’.

.. code:: powershell

   git add .
   git commit -m "new feature"

The shorty command can create a script to do the above operation without
the need to type out all the git command. To create a short script for
the command above just call ``shorty`` and add the command when prompt.
On prompt AliasName enter the name for your generated script. On the
Command prompt enter the commands if you are done youe .exit for the
command value.

.. code:: powershell

   shorty
   #AliasName: gc
   #Command: git add .
   #Command: git commit -m "new feature"
   #Command: .exit

You command will be generated in the folder
**$ProgramData/CronuxShorty/**. Then you can just call the script ``gc``
in your terminal instead of typing the git command.

Usage
-----

After installation you can use the commands independently as each batch
script will be generated for each command. Note that not all the command
will have it own script such as the **dir** command as it will conflict
with the installed dir program that comes pre-installed with windows.

E.g to open notepad as administrator

.. code:: bash

   elevate notepad

If you do not choose to install Cronux.bat use below to execute commands
from any folder. To use, extract Cronux.bat to a folder of your choice,
a sample use to open cmd as administrator

.. code:: bash

   Cronux elevate cmd

Powershell Exeception
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you try to execute the commands from powershell you will have to set
the Execution Policy to Bypass else you should call the .bat command
directly e.g instead of ``gitpush`` use ``gitpush.bat``. Top allow the
scripts to execute natively change the execution policy for your
powershell to bypass:

.. code:: powershell

   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass

or use the command in Cronux:

.. code:: powershell

   makepsunsafe.bat

After you are done with the session or when you want the Execution
policy to be secure again execute

.. code:: powershell

   Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

or use the command in Cronux:

.. code:: powershell

   makepssafeagain.bat

It advisable to make the Execution policy restricted for safety reasons.
